                             Introduction
=============================================================================
The DMTF libredfish library (https://github.com/DMTF/libredfish) is
leveraged by DxeRedfishLib since it provides excellent query language
and parsing logic. But the communication in original libredfish is based
on libcurl, which is not supported in UEFI. So, we replace libcurl with
EFI REST EX protocol to provide basic query abilities. Besides, we also
refined the APIs to return the HTTP StatusCode.

This HOWTO document provides the steps to build libredfish under UEFI
environment.

                      HOW to Install libredfish for UEFI Building
=============================================================================
  1. The user can use the below command to clone libredfish lib under the path:
  RedfishPkg\Library\LibredfishLib:

  $ git clone https://github.com/DMTF/libredfish.git

  2. LibredfishLib v1.0.0 is supported to build with UEFI. So, the user needs
  to checkout the tag version v1.0.0 under libredfish folder with command: 

  $ git checkout v1.0.0
  
  3. Building the raw libredfish in UEFI directly will have some building errors,
  the user needs to copy the file: Patch-Libredfish-For-UEFI.patch to libredfish
  folder and patch it with command:
  
  $ git am Patch-Libredfish-For-UEFI.patch
  
  4. The patched libredfish lib can pass build under UEFI environment.
