  Jansson is a C library for encoding, decoding and manipulating JSON data.
Its main features and design principles are:

  •Simple and intuitive API and data model
  •Comprehensive documentation
  •No dependencies on other libraries
  •Full Unicode support (UTF-8)
  •Extensive test suite

  Jansson is licensed under the MIT license. It is used in production and
its API is stable. It works on numerous platforms, including numerous Unix
like systems and Windows. It’s suitable for use on any system, including
desktop, server, and small embedded systems.

  In UEFI/EDKII environment, Redfish project consumes jansson to achieve JSON
operations. This HOWTO documents jansson building under UEFI/EDKII environment.

                      HOW to Install jansson for UEFI Building
=============================================================================

  1. The user can use the below command to clone jansson lib under the path:
  RedfishPkg\Library\JanssonLib.

  $ git clone https://github.com/akheron/jansson

  2. UEFI supports building with the jansson v2.12, the user needs to checkout
  to tag version: v2.12 under jansson folder with command:

  $ git checkout v2.12

  3. Building the raw jansson in UEFI directly will have some building errors,
  the user needs to copy the file: Patch-Jansson-For-UEFI.patch to jansson
  folder and patch it with command:

  $ git am Patch-Jansson-For-UEFI.patch

  4. The patched jansson lib should pass build under UEFI/EDKII environment.
